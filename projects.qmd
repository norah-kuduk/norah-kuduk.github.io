## Interactive Analysis of Formula 1 Qualifying Data
- **2024-2025, St. Lawrence University**  
- Developed an interactive Shiny application to analyze telemetry and qualifying data from Formula 1 races during the 2018 to 2024 seasons.  
- The project enables users to compare two drivers within the same race or track a single driver across different seasons.  
- Users can explore qualifying lap times and track performance metrics through customizable visualizations, enhancing engagement with complex motorsport data.  
- Technologies used include R, R Shiny, and advanced data visualization techniques.  
- Source code is available on GitHub: [f1-animate](https://github.com/norah-kuduk/f1-animate)

## AI in App Development with Flutter
- Developed a cross-platform physical therapy app aimed at athletes and individuals managing chronic injuries.  
- The app includes scheduling and calendar views for therapy routines, providing a robust set of standard exercises plus user customization options.  
- Built using Flutter and Dart for a responsive, user-friendly interface across platforms.  
- Utilized a PostgreSQL database deployed in a Docker container for managing exercise data, routine configurations, and user progress.  
- Server-side endpoints facilitate interaction with the database, ensuring efficient data handling.  
- Integrated AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to assist with coding, debugging, and problem-solving during development.  
- Designed a relational data model for storing exercises, routines, repetitions, and customizations.  
- This project reflects modern AI-augmented software development and cross-platform design trends in health technology.
